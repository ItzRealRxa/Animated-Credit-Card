# Assets

This folder holds images and other static assets used by the project.

Place your homepage screenshot at `assets/homepage.png`. The README references that path to display the screenshot.

To update the image:
- Upload `homepage.png` via GitHub web UI into this folder, or push it from your local machine using Git as shown in the project README.

If you want a different filename, update `README.md` to point to the new path.
